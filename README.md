# Slider With Tutorial

A small SPA made by me in *VueJS*. The text is in Russian but everything is pretty straightforward. Tried to make it adaptive, I think I have succeeded. Has both desktop and mobile versions.

On the second page, there's an input where you can enter a link to a picture (better be a big wallpaper), and then click on the + button to add that image to the slider.

Also, there is a brief tutorial in Russian telling you what you can do. That's pretty much it to this VueJS project.
